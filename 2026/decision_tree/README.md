# Decision Tree

This project implements a decision tree algorithm. A decision tree is a tree-like data structure that helps finding specific information by making successive decisions. Each decision narrows down the remaining options.

This project was inspired by the game called [Akinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinator) played through Alexa. In the game, a player thinks of a character, object, or animal, and Alexa asks a series of yes/no questions until it's confident enough to guess the character. This project uses shapes instead of characters or animals.

The following options are used to generate the shapes:
- **Shapes**: circle, square, triangle, hexagon
- **Colors**: red, green, blue
- **Filled**: yes, no
- **Dashed border**: yes, no
